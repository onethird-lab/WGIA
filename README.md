# WGIA
WGIA: GPU-accelerated whole-genome interaction analyzing for everyone

## Introduction
<strong>WGIA is an open-access web application developed for genome-wide interaction analysis</strong>. WGIA leverages GPU parallel technologies to significantly enhance computational efficiency. Its framework facilitates high-speed pairwise interaction analysis, enabling extensive exploration of genome-wide interactions in the era of big data in molecular biology.<br>

<strong>WGIA incorporates over 70 interaction processing functions</strong>, including correlation analysis within the same omics biomarkers (such as co-expression or differential co-expression for microarray and RNA-seq data, epigenetic interaction analysis, SNP-SNP interaction analysis) and the analysis of regulatory effects between different omics biomarkers (e.g., eQTLs, mQTLs, pQTLs).
